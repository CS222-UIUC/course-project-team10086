## Introduction
The Grade Recorder app is designed for students to track their grades. User can input what class they take and what type of assignment they have for each class. Then, the app will change the grade accordingly as the user input more of his/her grades. 

Checking and calculating grades for each course has been an annoying task. Our app alows students to integrade his grades scattered in different paltform into one app. The app alows student to manually input their grades which allows them to make future plans about the semester based on predicting grades.
